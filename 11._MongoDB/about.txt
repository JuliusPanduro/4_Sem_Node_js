Mongo db is a documented database, and operates with json and can save javascript objects into the db.
we dont have relations in mongo db, but we have seperated entities (called: collections)

collections(mongodb) <----> Tables(SQL)


relations (mongodb are not so good at relations, because there is no fixed mode to make relations)

some companies are using SQL for buisness logic, and mongodb for logging

jsonSchema vs. odm


C - insert = example:  db.actors.insert({ name: "Danny Devito" })
R - find = example: db.actors.find({}) or if you looking for some specific: db.actors.find({ name: "Danny" })
U - update = example: db.actors.update({"Where"},{"with"}) / db.actors.update({id:1},{$set:{ wife:{ nice: true}}})
D - deleteOne / deleteMany / remove = example db.actors.deleteOne({ name: "Danny Devito" }) will delete one and db.actors.remove({}) removes all
